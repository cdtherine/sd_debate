# The State of SD Debate
Hi. Here's everything I used in my project.

This is an explanation of the files in the **data** folder:
- debate.csv is raw data from all rounds
- debate_partic.csv is raw participant counts
- partic.csv is participant counts after cleaning
- gender_ind.csv is gender data for individual debaters
- gender_team.csv is by team; this also includes data on male-male, male-female, and female-female teams, which I didn't end up using
